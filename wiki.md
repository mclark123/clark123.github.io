Many people work out and diet. *However*, many people do not work out properly or diet properly to see the results they want to see. In the following wiki, you will learn the **basics of working out** and how to **properly diet** to see the results you want to see for beginners. The following content is based on my experiences and research for working out and dieting. 

## Proper Regimen
It is important to realize that working out and dieting is very easy and very obtainable. With proper dieting and proper technique, your goals could be very achievable. In terms of dieting, it all comes down to calories consumed versus calories burned or expended. Depending on your goals, you may want to eat less and work out more, or even eat more and still work out. In terms of technique, depending on the excerise, there are proper and improper ways to work out. When in tandum, working out correctly and dieting properly is not only easy, but very easy to integrate in your everyday life. With that in mind, you just need to decide what training and dieting regimen is right for you. 

## Proper Diet
When talking about diet, I oversimplified dieting earlier. While it is true that at face value, dieting revolves around calories consumed versus calories expended, it is more complicated than that. It also matters what you eat. Obviously eating fruits and vegetables and your other necessary food groups is important but it is especially important to keep track of the portion sizes of your food as well as whether or not the foods you eat have more carbohydrates, proteins, or sugars. Depending on your goals, depends on what and how much you should eat. If you want to lose weight, you should eat less overall, cut out sugars and have less carbohydrates as well as increase the time or intensity of workouts. If you would like to gain weight, especially muscle, you should eat more generally speaking. 

## Proper Technique
When working out or training, it is important to workout properly. Not only does it benefit you in that you wont get injured when using proper technique, with proper technique, you are able to develope muscle faster and more effeiciently. It is also important to seperate the muscle groups into training days. For example, lets say you start working out on a Monday. Mondays could be *leg day* which is when you focus on your leg muscles such as your quadraceps, calve muscles, hamstrings, and glutes. Tuesday could be a *push day* or *bicep and chest day* where you would focus on your pectoral muscles and your biceps. Wednesday could be a *shoulder day* where you workout your shoulders, delts, and traps. Lastly, Thursday could be a *pull day* where you would train your back muscles and triceps. For friday, Saturday, and Sunday, you can use those as rest days or focus on cario or core day. It is important to do each excercise with the proper weight so you do not strain or hurt yourself and also to do each repitition of the exercise you do to the best of your ability so you more efficiently grow muscle.
